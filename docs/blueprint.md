## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep sky blue (#3498DB) evokes a sense of professionalism, trust, and forward-thinking innovation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F4F4F4) creates a clean, neutral backdrop to ensure the content is the main focus.
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#E67E22) provides a warm, inviting contrast, drawing attention to key interactive elements like the 'Start Brainstorming ✨' button.
- Font pairing: Use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' offers a computerized, techy feel for titles, while 'Inter' is modern and readable for descriptions.
- Ensure generous whitespace and a clear visual hierarchy. The input area should dominate the initial screen, followed by the prominent call-to-action button.
- Subtle transition animations between the input screen and the structured App Blueprint display will make the UX feel polished and professional.
